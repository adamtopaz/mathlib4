# Extremally disconnected sets

This file develops some of the basic theory of extremally disconnected sets.

## Overview

This file defines the type `ExtrDisc` of all extremally (note: not "extremely"!)
disconnected spaces, and gives it the structure of a large category.

The Lean implementation: a term of type `ExtrDisc` is a pair, considering of
a term of type `CompHaus` (i.e. a compact Hausdorff topological space) plus
a proof that the space is extremally disconnected.
This is equivalent to the assertion that the term is projective in `CompHaus`,
in the sense of category theory (i.e., such that morphisms out of the object
can be lifted along epimorphisms).

This file defines the type of all extremally disconnected spaces, gives it the
structure of a large category, and proves some basic observations about this
category and various functors from it.

## Main definitions

* `ExtrDisc` : the category of extremally disconnected spaces.
* `ExtrDisc.toCompHaus` : the forgetful functor `ExtrDisc ⥤ CompHaus` from extremally disconnected
  spaces to compact Hausdorff spaces
* `ExtrDisc.toProfinite` : the functor from extremally disconnected spaces to profinite spaces.
